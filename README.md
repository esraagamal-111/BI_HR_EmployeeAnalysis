## Introduction
This project is to display Human resources Analysis using POWER BI. The problem satatement is an imaginary case scenario I thought about after seeing the dataset.

## Problem Statement
Our client a leading multinational corporation has been experiencing some puzzling trends in their employee turnover rates they suspect that there may be hidden factors causing valuable employees to leave.
As data master itâ€™s our job to dig deep into their HR data and uncover the truth.

Creating one a Human resource dynamic report which answer the following questions:
1. What is the gender breakdown of current employees in the company?
2. What is the race breakdown of current employees in the company? 
3. What is the age  distribution of the current employees in the company?
4. What is the percentage of employees works on Headquarter vs Remote?
5. What is the average length of employement who have been termenated?
6. How does the gender distribution vary across department and job titles?
7. what is the distribution of the job titles across the company?
8. Which department has the highest termination rate?
9. What is the employee distribution across the location state?
10. How has the company employees count changed over time based on hirdate and termination date?
11. What is the tenure distribution for each department?


## Data Sourcing
 the information was in one table:
- hr

Data was then locally extracted from Excel Workbook into Power BI for transformation, analysis and visualization.

## Data Transformation

Data cleaning was performed.
The table appeared to be clean.
The quality of each column is 100% with no error or nulls.
Below is a preview of the tables:

     


**HT Table**

For the HR Table, first rows were not headers and so resolved that by applying the "Use First row as header" action.
Change birthdate,hirdate,termdate to date date type
calculate age column.

## Data Model Design
The data required for this analysis are located in various tables.
Therfore, appropriate modelling is required.
A star Schema is designed with the Sales and Returns Table representing the fact table containing all redundant data, and to which other dimension tables are modelled or connected to, using the column that is common. Date Table was created in power query using list of max and min date from sales tables
Sales & Rturns Table has been modelled with:
- Date Table using the "Date"
- Product Table using "Productkey"
- Customers Tables via "CustomerKey"
- Date Tables via "Date"

## Data Aanalysis/ Visualization
Analysis was done using simple visuals since the tables have been perfectly modelled together.
Applied some Dax Function to get the required information

#### Sales performance is improving since 2010 till 2013 years.
